~~- read budget from get_overview()~~
~~- read current positions from get_Accounts_positions()~~
- implement stop loss using the lowest price over the range, using place_stop_loss_order()
- when a buy order is placed, confirm that the order goes through. (two alternatives are possible when this is not the case, either we up the price by the minimum possible price (probably 0.5 or something like that), or we cancel the buy order.)
~~- re-write the update_budget_from_past_trades to just update the owned_stocks, because I do not care about the budget, since I get that directly from the get_balance()~~
~~- implement a re-initializer of the avanza login.~~
~~- update budget after sell / buy orders~~
- Implement a historical data fetcher, so that we dont have to pull all the data each day for every ticker, just the current day. (or day -1 or smt)
- Reduce overhead by moving the avanzi_api data (realtime data) to be read from memory, and then written to a file. Instead of reading from a file. Make sure to clear the processed rows from memory
~~- Improve and refactor the realtime.py~~
